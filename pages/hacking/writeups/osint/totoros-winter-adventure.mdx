# Totoro's Winter Adventure Part 1

## Description

CTF: Sieberrsec CTF 4.0

Totoro on a winter adventure, \
In the snowy land he roam, \
He had a merry Christmas, \
And now it's time to roam.

The next day, Totoro boards a big bird, \
That takes to the sky with all its might, \
Part of a starry alliance, soaring high, \
On a journey through the winter night.

He goes by @totorogoesnyan, \
Sharing all his travels with delight, \
He'd like to be reminded of the flight, \
The number and the time it took to the skies.

So let's all follow @totorogoesnyan, \
On his winter travels through the land, \
We'll see where the big bird flies, \
And all the adventures at hand.

Example flag: `IRS{SQ123_1200}` \
(Flight SQ123 which took off at 12:00 PM SGT)

## Solution

### Analysing the Description

First, what are we trying to find?

> Example flag: `IRS{SQ123_1200}` \
> (Flight SQ123 which took off at 12:00 PM SGT)

We are looking for

1. the flight number,
2. the takeoff time.

Next, let's analyse the poem.

> Totoro on a winter adventure, \
> In the snowy land he roam, \
> He had a merry Christmas, \
> And now it's time to roam.

Winter and snow is involved. Christmas just passed.

> The next day, Totoro boards a big bird, \
> That takes to the sky with all its might,

The plane is boarded the day after Christmas (26 Dec).

> Part of a starry alliance, soaring high, \
> On a journey through the winter sky.

The airline operating the plane is part of the
[Star Alliance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Alliance), the world's
largest global airline alliance. If you didn't already know this, Googling for
`starry alliance` or `starry alliance plane` would've told you this.

> He goes by @totorogoesnyan, \
> Sharing all his travels with delight

Totoro shares his travels on social media, by the handle `@totorogoesnyan`.

> He'd like to be reminded of the flight, \
> The number and the time it took to the skies.

This is a repetition of what we are looking for.

> So let's all follow @totorogoesnyan, \
> On his winter travels through the land, \
> We'll see where the big bird flies, \
> And all the adventures at hand.

This social media platform uses the verb `follow`. Though, most do so this
doesn't help much.

### Digging on Social Media

First, let's try Googling for `@totorogoesnyan`. A simple search query
`"totorogoesnyan"` yields nothing. This means that it probably hasn't been
indexed by Google yet.

Thus, we have to turn to the search engines of the individual social media
platforms. If we try searching on the large social media platforms, we find that
there is a user that goes by
[`@totorogoesnyan`](https://www.instagram.com/totorogoesnyan/) on Instagram.

![](/images/sieberrsec-ctf-2022/totoros-winter-adventure-1.png)

At this point, we should look specifically for posts made on 26 Dec on
[`@totorogoesnyan`](https://www.instagram.com/totorogoesnyan/). Many got mislead
by the following post which shows a plane wing, but was on 24 Dec. It was
actually a separately booked flight from SIN-TPE :P

![](/images/sieberrsec-ctf-2022/totoros-winter-adventure-2.png)

These are all the posts from 26 Dec:

![](/images/sieberrsec-ctf-2022/totoros-winter-adventure-3.png)

![](/images/sieberrsec-ctf-2022/totoros-winter-adventure-4.png)

![](/images/sieberrsec-ctf-2022/totoros-winter-adventure-5.png)

![](/images/sieberrsec-ctf-2022/totoros-winter-adventure-6.png)

Notably, the second post is from a view of the departure area at what is
probably an airport terminal, and the fourth post is from immigration at what is
probably an airport too.

It seems that these posts include locations too! If we copy and paste these
locations into Google, we find that the second and third post were taken in
`Taoyuan International Airport (TPE) Terminal 2` and the fourth in
`New Chitose Airport (CTS) International Terminal`

Since the second and third post are both at the airport, one can reasonably
assume the third post is at an airport lounge in the departure area. Since the
fourth post is at a different airport, one can reasonably assume the immigration
is at the arrival area. Thus, the flight must be from TPE to CTS.

Let's check the exact times these posts were made. To check beneath surface of
what the user interface of a website tells you, the first thing to try is to
check the sorce code. By using the `Inspect Element` tool to check the source
code, we find the exact time of the posts.

![](/images/sieberrsec-ctf-2022/totoros-winter-adventure-7.png)

After converting to SGT (UTC+8), the post times are

- 08:15:43 (TPE)
- 08:28:57 (TPE)
- 15:49:10 (CTS)

### Finding the Flight

This gives us a time range of 7 h 20 min to work with. Since boarding usually
takes place 30 min before the gate closes and Totoro was still at the lounge, it
would be reasonable to shift the lower bound of the time range up by 30 min.
Also considering the time it took to deplane and get from the gate to the
immigration hall at CTS, it would be reasonable to assume Totoro flew within a
6.5 h period.

A direct flight from TPE to CTS usually takes about 3.5 h. There are two major
transit stops for flights between TPE and CTS. If flying through HND, the
flights take approximately 2 h 50 min and 1 h 35 min respectively. If flying
through KIX, the flights take approximately 2 h 25 min and 1 h 55 min
respectively. Thus, it would be reasonable to also consider the option that
Totoro made a transit stop. However, since the challenge only asks for one
flight number, let's try looking for direct flights first.

There are many sites with freely available historical flight information. One of
the most common sites is [www.flightradar24.com](https://www.flightradar24.com),
which gives us a list of daily flights from TPE-CTS. There are many other sites
you can use for this, and Googling would easily help you find them.

![](/images/sieberrsec-ctf-2022/totoros-winter-adventure-8.png)

These seem to be the flights from TPE-CTS:

- 0555–1030, `IT234` (Tigerair Taiwan)
- 0835–1310, `CI130` (China Airlines)
- 0925–1400, `JX850` (Starlux)
- 0930–1405, `BR116` (EVA Air)

Based on the scheduled times of the flights, we should be considering `CI130`,
`JX850`, and `BR116`. At this point, it is worth noting that posts can only be
made after an event and not before, which we should keep in mind whenever we are
looking for time information on social media.

Upon checking through which airlines are in the
[Star Alliance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Alliance) mentioned in the
poem, we actually narrow this down to `BR116`.

Submitting `IRS{BR116_0930}` at this point would fail. This is because the
scheduled departure time of flights usually refers to the time of departure from
the gate. The plane still has to taxi to the runway before it can take off. Many
failed to realise that the challenge was asking for the takeoff time
specifically.

> Hint: What exactly does it mean to take to the skies?

Those who purchased the hint could refer to it to realise this.

The specific takeoff time is usually not released by airlines or airports.
However, it is recorded in many flight tracker websites. These websites use
[ADS-B](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_Dependent_Surveillance%E2%80%93Broadcast)
information to track the locations of planes with their transponders on
throughout the flight.

![](/images/sieberrsec-ctf-2022/totoros-winter-adventure-9.png)

[planefinder.net](https://planefinder.net) is one of the sites that offers this
feature. As you can see, the flight on 12 Jan was at the start of the runway
at 0948. Unfortunately, I couldn't get a screenshot of the 26 Dec flight because
it requires a paid subscription. However, at the time of the CTF the 26 Dec
flight history was still available on [planefinder.net](https://planefinder.net)
for free, which also showed that the plane was at the start of the runway at
0948, and took off furter down the runway at 0949.

Many who tried to find the historical ADS-B information were faced with paywalls
and got stuck from there. However, there are actually several ways to bypass
paywalls on these sites. For example, one of the participants used
[web.archive.org](http://web.archive.org).

I tried a different method that worked on
[flightaware.com](https://flightaware.com), which also happened to be the first
result on Google for me. It provided flight history with links that looked like
`https://flightaware.com/live/flight/EVA116/history/20221231/0140Z/RCTP/RJCC`. I
simply changed the date to `20221226` and got past the paywall.

![](/images/sieberrsec-ctf-2022/totoros-winter-adventure-10.png)

This site clearly shows the takeoff time as 0949. Note that CST here refers to
China Standard Time (UTC+8), not the more common Central Standard Time (UTC-6).
One would be able to infer this because that is the timezone used in the origin
airport which is in Taiwan.

If we try submitting BR116 which took off around 0949, it works. 0948 and
codeshare flight numbers were also accepted.

# Totoro's Winter Adventure Part 2

## Description

CTF: Sieberrsec CTF 4.0

Totoro, the loveable creature, \
Partook in a wintery feature, \
Sliding down the snowy mountain, \
On two long plastic boards counting,

A video of Totoro's escapades, \
Leaked onto the dark web shades, \
Where only the tech-savvy can see, \
The furry friend's ski escapade spree.

Totoro went down three untrivial slopes, \
Of significant steepness, as it copes, \
The middle slope was used to cut across, \
The other two slopes, no time to dawdle or pause.

But this middle slope was bumpy, oh so rough, \
Totoro hung on tight, that was enough, \
To make it through the bumps and the jumps, \
And safely make it down, no time to dump.

But what was the name of that first slope, \
The one where Totoro first had to cope, \
With the icy winds and the snowy trails, \
The one that started Totoro's snowy escapades?

## Solution

### Analysing the Description

> Example flag: `IRS{Fun Course 1-A}` \
> (The example's first slope is called "Fun Course 1-A")

We're looking for a ski slope this time :0

The poem:

> Totoro, the loveable creature, \
> Partook in a wintery feature, \
> Sliding down the snowy mountain, \
> On two long plastic boards counting,

Sliding down a snowy mountain on two long plastic boards—skiing.

> A video of Totoro's escapades, \
> Leaked onto the dark web shades, \
> Where only the tech-savvy can see, \
> The furry friend's ski escapade spree.

There's a video of it somewhere. We find it in the link below
([https://go.skytect.one/totoroski](https://go.skytect.one/totoroski)).

> Totoro went down three untrivial slopes, \
> Of significant steepness, as it copes, \

Three slopes that were not that easy. The middle slope used to cut across frm
one slope to the other?

> But this middle slope was bumpy, oh so rough, \
> Totoro hung on tight, that was enough, \
> To make it through the bumps and the jumps, \
> And safely make it down, no time to dump.

The middle slope was particularly bumpy?

> But what was the name of that first slope, \
> The one where Totoro first had to cope, \
> With the icy winds and the snowy trails, \
> The one that started Totoro's snowy escapades?

Look for the name of the first of three slopes Totoro went down.

### Looking Through the Video

At this point, we have to refer to the video to figure out more information.

# Totoro's Winter Adventure Part 3

## Description

CTF: Sieberrsec CTF 4.0

Totoro visited a beach, \
Near an airport within reach, \
On an island country that retreated, \
From the mainland, its fate met.

The beach was along the western coastline, \
Usually crowded during summertime, \
But eerily quiet when Totoro came, \
In the winter's chill, a different game.

Next to the beach was a harbour full, \
Of fishing boats and nautical hull, \
A rainbow bridge stood tall and proud, \
But alas, it was not at all rainbow, not a single shade aloud.

What was the name of the road that went, \
Through the entire harbour, its intent, \
To connect and connect, from side to side, \
This road that Totoro often did abide?

Example flag: `IRS{Haibian Rd}` \
(The example's road on an English version of Google Maps is called "Haibian Rd")

We need to find the English name of a road on Google Maps.

Poem:

> Totoro visited a beach, \
> Near an airport within reach, \

We're looking for a beach near an airport.

> On an island country that retreated, \
> From the mainland, its fate met.

It's likely in Taiwan. This can be inferred from the Instagram in previous
parts.

> The beach was along the western coastline, \
> Usually crowded during summertime, \
> But eerily quiet when Totoro came, \
> In the winter's chill, a different game.

The beach is on the western coast. It also happens to be mostly frequented
during the summer.

> Next to the beach was a harbour full, \
> Of fishing boats and nautical hull, \

The beach was next to a fishing boat harbour.

> A rainbow bridge stood tall and proud, \
> But alas, it was not at all rainbow, not a single shade aloud.

A rainbow bridge that isn't rainbow in colour?

> What was the name of the road that went, \
> Through the entire harbour, its intent, \
> To connect and connect, from side to side, \
> This road that Totoro often did abide?

We're looking for the road that goes through the entire harbour.
