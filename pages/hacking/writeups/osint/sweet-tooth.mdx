Let's visit the CSA website and pick out an arbitrary file (`csa-logo.jpg`).

If we try searching for the **filename** on GitHub and sort by **Recently
Indexed**, we find `chachabooboo/csawebsite`. The username resembles the dessert
[bubur cha cha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubur_cha_cha).

If we visit the profile page, we find the flag.
