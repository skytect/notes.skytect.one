CTF: Whitehacks 2021

So, it's my friend's birthday soon and I want to surprise him. His name is
Andrew Yeoh Boon How and I heard he's quite active on Twitter. Can you help me
find out when is his birthday?

Note: Making any contact with the person is out of scope.

# Birthday Surprise B - The Cake Still Tick-Tocking

Now that we found out when is his birthday, we need to find out his favourite
cake! He might have other social media. Not really sure though, he never
mentioned it to me. The only thing I know is that he said he often vlogged
somewhere.

If we google around, we are able to find his TikTok account under the same
username.

With more googling, we are able to find his Instagram account under the same
username.

- In his 1st post, he reveals that he lives a few MRT stops away from **Gardens
  by the Bay**.
- If you google `singapore pools "B1-37"` from the image in the 2nd post, we can
  determine that the image was taken at **Sim Lim Square**.
- Under the comments of his 2nd post, it is revealed that his house has a
  **bakkwa store** alongside a **bakery** directly below.
- His 3rd post is of **Fu Lu Shou Complex**.

If we google for bakkwa stores around the area, we find Kim Hock Guan at **The
Bencoolen**.
