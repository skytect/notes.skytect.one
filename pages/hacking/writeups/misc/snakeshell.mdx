## Solution

_Solved by [@teamfreestuff](https://github.com/teamfreestuff)_

The shell has a prompt for number of tries which uses the `input()` function in Python 2. This function does not take your input as a string, and is essentially the same as `eval(raw_input())`.

For example, the payload `7 * 7` would yield `49`.

If we pass the payload `__import__('os').listdir()`, we will realise that there is a peculiar file titled `flag` in the same directory.

By using `__import__('os').open('flag').read()` which reads the `flag` file, we are able to obtain the flag.
