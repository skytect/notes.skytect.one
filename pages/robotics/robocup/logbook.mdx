## February 2023

### 22 February

```
kiid
- one way to reduce errors while soldering is just to cut off useless pins ðŸ¤£
- make sure pads and heat slugs are clear of solder before soldering on (use solderpaste)
```

### 21 February

```
kiid
- we are going france ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·  (provided everything else works as intended LOL)
- I need to find a more reliable method of soldering
- more or less waiting for taobao parts to arrive before first bot is made and tested
```

### 20 February

```
kiid
- fixed shorting
- fixed driver heat slugs not touching pcb
- *why doesn't the driver work???*
might have fried it when desoldering idk

- desoldered resoldered still no output unsure why
- will try another method of solder tmr
    = only solder the required pins (ina, inb, pwm, ena, enb, gnd)
    = solder paste rather than solder on the slugs
```

### 17 February

```
kiid
- LDRs work
- STM32 work
- LEDs work
- bucks work
- motor 12v and gnd shorted; will debug next week
```

### 11 February

```
prototype of bot assembled!!!
```

### 10 February

```
kiid
- received PCBs
- started soldering
```

### 6 February

```
kiid
- finished designing v1 of l1, l2 and l3
- ordered pcbs
```

## January 2023

- https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/291483/why-the-inductor-size-increases-even-when-the-value-of-the-inductor-is-same
```

### 20â€“24 January

```
kiid
- long cny break
```

### 15â€“19 January

```
kiid
- my boost and kicker control circuit works!!
```

### 9 January

```
kiid
- tested stm32 test pcb
- worked
- start work on main pcb

current plan:
- ditching f401; remain on f103cbt6; will attempt to make f401 work when time permits
- ditching usb comparability; use swd to program instead
- single mosfet kicker activator circuit, as I am sceptical of the amount of heat that is reasonably dissipated during a normal match
```

### 3 January

```
kiid
- finished and ordered stm32 test pcb
```

### 1 January

```
kiid
- new year
```

## December 2022

```
kiid
- hokkaido
- nothing on my test pcb works lol
```

## November 2022

### 24 November

```
kiid
- finished and ordered test pcb #1
```

### 14 November

```
kiid
- usb data uses differential pairs coolz
```

### 8 November

```
kiid
- testing new way of activating solenoid with only 1 mosfet
    = logic level power MOSFET (IRLB3036PbF)
        == Rds(on) at 4.5V of 2mÎ©
        == Vdss of 60V (so cannot charge solenoid up too high)
    = power mosfet with good specs (IRFB4110PbF)
        == Rds(on) at 5V of <66mÎ©
        == Vdss of 100V
        == requires open drain mod + ext pull-up on stm32
```

## October 2022

### 15 October

```
kiid
- figured how to create 3d models of chips using Fusion 360's package generator ðŸ¥³
```

### 13 October

```
kiid
- started to brainstorm about possible improvements to robot
- read up on specs on different stm32 series
```

### 12 October

```
kiid
- bruh i finally know whats a capcitor
- vias are inductors
```
